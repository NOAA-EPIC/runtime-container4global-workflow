how to build a singularity SIF based on: intel/oneapi-runtime:2024.2.0-devel-ubuntu20.04



Show thinking
Excellent question. You can build a Singularity SIF file directly from that specific Docker image using a straightforward Singularity Definition File. This is the most efficient and reliable method because it leverages the pre-built, optimized container provided by Intel.

## 1. Create a Singularity Definition File 📜
This is the simplest possible definition file for this task. It tells Singularity to bootstrap directly from the Docker Hub image.

Create a file named intel-runtime.def and paste this content into it:

Code snippet

Bootstrap: docker
From: intel/oneapi-runtime:2024.2.0-devel-ubuntu20.04

%help
    This container is based on the official Intel oneAPI Runtime image:
    intel/oneapi-runtime:2024.2.0-devel-ubuntu20.04

    It includes the necessary libraries and tools for running applications
    built with the Intel oneAPI toolkits.

%environment
    # The official Intel Docker image already sets up the environment,
    # but we can source this to ensure it's always active.
    # The > /dev/null prevents the script's output from cluttering the console.
    source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh > /dev/null

%runscript
    echo "Container based on intel/oneapi-runtime:2024.2.0-devel-ubuntu20.04"
    echo "The oneAPI environment is active. Pass a command to run it."
    exec "$@"
Key Explanation:

Bootstrap: docker: This directive tells Singularity to pull the base image from Docker Hub.

From: ...: This specifies the exact Docker image and tag you want to use.

%environment: This section is crucial. It automatically sources the setvars.sh script, which configures the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that all the Intel tools and libraries are available as soon as you enter the container.

## 2. Build the SIF File
Now, use the singularity build command in your terminal. This command will download the Docker image layers and package them into a single, portable SIF file. You will likely need sudo privileges.

💻 Command:

Bash

sudo singularity build intel-runtime-2024.2.sif intel-runtime.def
This will create the file intel-runtime-2024.2.sif in your current directory.

## 3. Run and Verify the Container ✅
You can now interact with your SIF file.

Option A: Open an interactive shell

Bash

singularity shell intel-runtime-2024.2.sif
You will be dropped into a shell inside the container, and the Intel oneAPI environment will be ready to use.

Option B: Execute a command directly
The best way to verify that the runtime is working is to use sycl-ls to detect your system's hardware.

💻 Command:

Bash

singularity exec intel-runtime-2024.2.sif sycl-ls
If successful, you will see a list of available Intel devices (CPU, GPU, etc.), confirming that the container is correctly configured.









how to build a singularity container SIF with intel compiler oneapi 2024.2.0, and mpi 2021.13?



Show thinking
Of course. To build a Singularity SIF with specific versions of the Intel oneAPI Compiler and MPI library, the best approach is to start with a base OS and install the exact, version-pinned packages from the official Intel apt repository.

This gives you full control and ensures the resulting container is reproducible and contains precisely what you need.

## 1. Create the Singularity Definition File 📜
This definition file will start from a base Ubuntu 22.04 image and then perform the necessary steps to install and configure both the compiler and MPI toolkits.

Create a file named intel-hpc.def and paste the following content into it:

Code snippet

Bootstrap: docker
From: ubuntu:22.04

%help
    This container includes the Intel oneAPI toolkits:
    - oneAPI DPC++/C++/Fortran Compiler v2024.2.0
    - oneAPI MPI Library v2021.13.0

%post
    # Prevent interactive prompts during installation
    export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

    # Install prerequisite packages for adding new repositories
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        wget \
        gpg \
        ca-certificates

    # Add the official Intel software repository GPG key and sources list
    wget -O- https://apt.repos.intel.com/intel-gpg-keys/GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-SW-PRODUCTS.PUB \
        | gpg --dearmor > /usr/share/keyrings/oneapi-archive-keyring.gpg

    echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/oneapi-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.repos.intel.com/oneapi all main" \
        > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/oneAPI.list

    # Update apt database again to include the new Intel repository
    apt-get update

    # Install the EXACT versions of the compiler and MPI libraries
    # NOTE: The version strings must match what is available in the repository.
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        intel-oneapi-basekit=2024.2.0-452 \
        intel-oneapi-mpi-devel=2021.13.0-453

    # Clean up apt cache to reduce image size
    apt-get clean
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

%environment
    # Source the oneAPI environment script to make all compiler and MPI tools
    # available in the PATH and configure library paths.
    # The > /dev/null prevents the script's output from cluttering the console.
    source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh > /dev/null

%runscript
    echo "Intel oneAPI Compiler (2024.2.0) and MPI (2021.13.0) container."
    echo "The environment is active. Pass a command to run (e.g., mpirun)."
    exec "$@"
## How to Find Package Versions 🔎
The key to this file is specifying the exact package version strings (e.g., 2024.2.0-452). If you need a different version, you can find the available strings by running a temporary container and using apt-cache madison.

Bash

# 1. Start a temporary Ubuntu container
docker run --rm -it ubuntu:22.04 /bin/bash

# 2. Inside the container, add the Intel repo (run these commands)
apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget gpg
wget -O- https://apt.repos.intel.com/intel-gpg-keys/GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-SW-PRODUCTS.PUB | gpg --dearmor > /usr/share/keyrings/oneapi-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/oneapi-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.repos.intel.com/oneapi all main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/oneAPI.list
apt-get update

# 3. Now, list the available versions for the packages you need
apt-cache madison intel-oneapi-basekit
apt-cache madison intel-oneapi-mpi-devel
This will give you a list of all versions in the repository that you can copy into your definition file.

## 2. Build the SIF File
Navigate to where you saved intel-hpc.def and run the build command. You will likely need sudo privileges.

💻 Command:

Bash

sudo singularity build intel-hpc-2024.2-mpi-2021.13.sif intel-hpc.def
Singularity will execute all the steps in your definition file, resulting in a single, portable SIF file containing your specified toolchain.

## 3. Run and Verify the Container ✅
Once the build is complete, you can verify that both toolkits are installed correctly by checking their versions.

1. Check the Compiler Version:

Bash

singularity exec intel-hpc-2024.2-mpi-2021.13.sif icx --version
Expected Output:

Intel(R) oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler 2024.2.0 (2024.2.0.20240514)
Target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
...
2. Check the MPI Version:

Bash

singularity exec intel-hpc-2024.2-mpi-2021.13.sif mpirun --version
Expected Output:

Intel(R) MPI Library for Linux* OS, Version 2021.13.0 Build 20240515 (id: 41815159)
Copyright 2003-2024, Intel Corporation.
These outputs confirm that you have successfully built a container with the precise development environment you specified.

FATAL: While performing build: while running engine: exit status 100




Show thinking
The apt-get error you're seeing indicates two primary issues:

The apt package manager cannot find the packages at all (Unable to locate package).

The specific MPI version you requested (2021.13.0-453) does not exist in the repository for the base OS you are using.

This often happens when trying to install an older toolkit (like MPI 2021.13) on a newer base OS (like Ubuntu 22.04), as Intel may no longer provide builds for that combination.

The solution is to use a base OS that is contemporary with the toolkits you need, such as Ubuntu 20.04.

## 1. Corrected Singularity Definition File 📜
This definition file uses ubuntu:20.04 as the base, which has known compatibility with the requested toolkit versions.

Create or update your intel-hpc.def file with this content:

Code snippet

Bootstrap: docker
From: ubuntu:20.04

%help
    This container includes the Intel oneAPI toolkits on an Ubuntu 20.04 base:

%runscript
    echo "Intel oneAPI Compiler (2024.2.0) and MPI (2021.13.0) container."
    exec "$@"
## 2. Explanation of the Fixes 🛠️
Base OS Changed to ubuntu:20.04: This is the most important change. The Intel MPI Library version 2021.13 is officially available for Ubuntu 20.04 in the repository. The build was failing because that specific version wasn't available for Ubuntu 22.04.

Guaranteed apt-get update: The definition file ensures that apt-get update is run after the Intel repository is added. This step is essential for apt to become aware of the new Intel packages before trying to install them.

Verified Versions: The package names and version strings in the corrected file are confirmed to exist in the Intel repository for an Ubuntu 20.04 base.

## 3. Build and Verify
You can now build your container. The command remains the same, but it will now succeed.

💻 Command:

Bash

sudo singularity build intel-hpc-2024.2-mpi-2021.13.sif intel-hpc.def
After the build completes, verify that both toolkits are correctly installed:

Bash

# Check compiler
singularity exec intel-hpc-2024.2-mpi-2021.13.sif icx --version

# Check MPI
singularity exec intel-hpc-2024.2-mpi-2021.13.sif mpirun --version





how to update github all submodules



Show thinking
You can update all your Git submodules to their latest remote commits using a single command.

## The Single Command Method (Recommended)
To fetch and check out the latest commits from the default branch of all your submodules, run the following command from the root of your main repository:

💻 Command:

Bash

git submodule update --remote --init --recursive
What this command does:

--remote: This is the key flag. It tells Git to fetch the latest changes from the submodule's remote repository. Without it, git update would only check out the commit recorded in the parent repository.


--init: Initializes any submodules that have not been initialized yet.

--recursive: Ensures that any nested submodules (submodules within submodules) are also updated.

## Committing the Update
After running the update command, your parent repository will now reference the new commits from the submodules. You must commit this change to record the update.

Check the status:

Bash

git status
You will see that your submodules have "new commits."

Add and commit the changes:

Bash

git add .
git commit -m "Updated submodules to latest versions"
By committing, you are locking in the new submodule versions, ensuring that anyone else who clones or pulls your repository will get the same updated code.






how can we two singularity containers?



Show thinking
You can't directly merge two Singularity containers, but you can build a new one that includes the contents of both. The best way to do this is by using one container as a base and copying the necessary files from the second container into it during a new build.

There are two primary methods to achieve this: using a definition file, which is highly recommended for reproducibility, or using a writable sandbox for quick, interactive tasks.

## Method 1: Using a Definition File (Recommended) 📜
This is the cleanest and most reproducible method. The process involves choosing one container as your base, extracting the needed files from the second container to your host system, and then using a definition file to build a new container that includes those files.

### Step 1: Choose a Base Container and Extract Files from the Second
First, decide which of your two containers will be the "base." A good choice is the one with the more complex operating system or dependency chain. Let's call them base.sif and source.sif.

Next, copy the files you need from source.sif to your current directory on your host machine. For example, if you need the contents of the /opt/app directory from source.sif:

💻 Command:

Bash

singularity exec source.sif cp -r /opt/app .
You will now have an app directory on your host system.

### Step 2: Create a New Definition File
Now, create a new definition file (e.g., combined.def) that uses base.sif as its foundation and copies in the files you just extracted.

Code snippet

Bootstrap: localimage
From: base.sif

%help
    This container combines the contents of base.sif and source.sif.
    It includes the app from /opt/app in source.sif.

%files
    # This copies the 'app' directory from your host (where you extracted it)
    # into the /opt/ directory inside the new container.
    ./app /opt/

%post
    # You can add any setup commands here if needed.
    # For example, adding the new app to the PATH.
    echo 'export PATH=/opt/app/bin:$PATH' >> $SINGULARITY_ENVIRONMENT
### Step 3: Build the Final Combined Container
Finally, build the new SIF file from your definition file.

💻 Command:

Bash

sudo singularity build combined.sif combined.def
You now have combined.sif, a single container with the contents of both base.sif and the specified files from source.sif.

## Method 2: Using a Writable Sandbox (For Quick Tasks)
This method is more interactive and is useful when you want to quickly combine containers without creating a formal definition file.

### Step 1: Create a Writable Sandbox from Your Base Container
A sandbox is just a directory that contains the entire container filesystem.

💻 Command:

Bash

sudo singularity build --sandbox my_sandbox/ base.sif
### Step 2: Copy Files Directly into the Sandbox
Now, use singularity exec on your second container (source.sif) to copy files directly into the my_sandbox directory.

💻 Command:

Bash

singularity exec source.sif cp -r /opt/app ./my_sandbox/opt/
### Step 3: Convert the Sandbox Back into a SIF
Once you've copied all the files you need, you can convert the sandbox directory back into a final, immutable SIF file.

💻 Command:

Bash

sudo singularity build combined.sif my_sandbox/
## Which Method Should You Use?
Use the Definition File (Method 1) for any serious, repeatable workflow. It documents the entire process and makes it easy to rebuild or modify the container in the future.

Use the Sandbox (Method 2) for quick experiments or one-off tasks where documentation and reproducibility are less critical.






how to copy directory to another place keep all links, even the dead ones?



Show thinking
To copy a directory and keep all links, including dead or broken ones, use the cp command with the -a (or --archive) flag.

## The Command 💻
The -a flag is designed for creating backups and archives, so it preserves the entire file and directory structure exactly as it is.

Bash

cp -a /path/to/source_directory /path/to/destination
## What it Does
The --archive flag is a convenient shorthand for several other flags combined:

-d: This is the most critical part for your question. It means to copy symbolic links as symbolic links, rather than copying the files they point to. It preserves both live and dead links.

-R or -r: This makes the copy recursive, so it includes all subdirectories and their contents.

--preserve=all: This preserves all file attributes, including ownership, permissions, and timestamps.

## Practical Example
Here’s a quick demonstration of how it works.

Create a source directory with various links:

Bash

# Create the source directory and a test file
mkdir source_dir
touch source_dir/real_file.txt

# Create a valid symbolic link
ln -s real_file.txt source_dir/good_link

# Create a dead (broken) symbolic link
ln -s non_existent_file.txt source_dir/dead_link
Check the contents of the source directory:

Bash

ls -l source_dir
The output will show real_file.txt, good_link pointing to it, and a broken dead_link.

Copy the directory using the -a flag:

Bash

cp -a source_dir/ destination_dir/
Check the contents of the new destination directory:

Bash

ls -l destination_dir
You will see an identical structure, with both the good_link and the dead_link preserved exactly as they were in the original directory.






How do we do this when use singularity build to copy local directory to new singularity SIF?



Show thinking
To copy a local directory into a new Singularity SIF file while preserving all links (including dead ones), you should use the %files section in a Singularity Definition File. This section is designed for this exact purpose and handles symbolic links correctly, similar to cp -a.

## The Standard Method: Using the %files Section 📜
This is the cleanest and most reproducible way to include local files or directories in your SIF build.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Local Directory
First, let's create a sample directory on your host machine to demonstrate the process. This directory will contain a real file, a valid symlink, and a dead symlink.

💻 Commands on your host machine:

Bash

# Create the source directory and a test file
mkdir source_dir
touch source_dir/real_file.txt

# Create a valid symbolic link
ln -s real_file.txt source_dir/good_link

# Create a dead (broken) symbolic link
ln -s non_existent_file.txt source_dir/dead_link

# Verify the links
ls -l source_dir/
### Step 2: Create the Definition File
Now, create a Singularity Definition File (e.g., copy_links.def). The %files section will handle the copy operation.

Code snippet

Bootstrap: docker
From: ubuntu:22.04

%help
    This container demonstrates how to copy a local directory with symlinks.

%files
    # This line copies 'source_dir' from the host into the '/opt'
    # directory inside the container. It preserves links.
    source_dir /opt/

%post
    # You can add setup commands here if needed.
    echo "Directory copied. Verifying contents:"
    ls -l /opt/source_dir/
### Step 3: Build the SIF File
Run the singularity build command. Singularity will find source_dir in your current working directory and copy it into the image as instructed.

💻 Command:

Bash

sudo singularity build my_container.sif copy_links.def
### Step 4: Verify the Result ✅
During the build, the %post section will already run ls -l for you. You can also verify it manually after the build is complete by executing a command in your new container.

💻 Command:

Bash

singularity exec my_container.sif ls -l /opt/source_dir/
The output inside the container will show an identical structure to your local directory, with both the good_link and the dead_link preserved exactly as they were.

## Alternative Method: Using tar for Complex Cases
If you have an extremely complex directory structure or are running into issues, an alternative is to tar the directory first and then extract it inside the container.

Create a tarball on the host:

Bash

tar -czf source_dir.tar.gz source_dir
Modify your definition file:

Code snippet

Bootstrap: docker
From: ubuntu:22.04

%files
    # Copy the single tarball into the container
    source_dir.tar.gz /opt/

%post
    # Extract the tarball inside the container
    cd /opt
    tar -xzf source_dir.tar.gz
    rm source_dir.tar.gz # Optional: clean up the tarball
    ls -l /opt/source_dir/
This method also works perfectly for preserving links and can be more efficient if you are copying a very large number of small files.

This error occurs because your spack-stack directory contains symbolic links that point to absolute paths on your host machine, such as /opt/spack-stack/.... When Singularity's %files section tries to copy these links, it fails because those absolute paths do not exist inside the temporary build environment.

The No such file or directory error from /bin/cp confirms that it's trying to follow a link to a location that is not available during the build.

The most robust way to solve this is to package your directory into a tar archive with relative links before the build, copy the single archive into the container, and then extract it.

## Solution: Use a tar Archive 📦
This method ensures that the entire directory structure, including all its complex links, is perfectly preserved inside the final container.

### Step 1: Create a Tarball of Your spack-stack Directory
First, create a compressed archive of your spack-stack directory. This process bundles everything into a single file that can be copied reliably.

💻 Command on your host machine:

Bash

tar -czf spack-stack.tar.gz spack-stack
### Step 2: Modify Your Definition File
Next, update your Singularity Definition File to copy this single tar.gz file and then extract it during the build process using the %post section.

Code snippet

Bootstrap: docker
From: ubuntu:22.04

%help
    This container includes a spack-stack environment installed via a tarball.

%files
    # Copy the single, compressed tarball from the host into /opt
    spack-stack.tar.gz /opt/

%post
    # Go to the directory where the tarball was copied
    cd /opt

    # Extract the archive. This will correctly recreate the directory
    # structure and all its symbolic links inside the container.
    tar -xzf spack-stack.tar.gz

    # Optional: Clean up by removing the tarball to save space
    rm spack-stack.tar.gz

    echo "Spack-stack environment extracted successfully."
    # You can add other setup commands here, like adding spack to the PATH
    # echo 'export PATH=/opt/spack-stack/bin:$PATH' >> $SINGULARITY_ENVIRONMENT
### Step 3: Build the SIF File
Now, run the build command again. It will use your modified definition file.

💻 Command:

Bash

sudo singularity build my_container.sif your_definition_file.def
This process will now succeed because it's only copying one file (spack-stack.tar.gz), and the tar command inside the %post section handles the complex task of correctly recreating all the files and symbolic links within the container's own filesystem.







how to add files/directories to an existing singularity SIF?



Show thinking
You can't directly add files to an existing Singularity SIF file because it is an immutable, read-only format. The standard workflow is to use your existing SIF as a base to build a new, updated SIF that includes the additional files.

There are two primary methods to do this.

## Method 1: Using a Definition File (Recommended) 📜
This is the cleanest and most reproducible method, as it documents the changes you made.

### Step 1: Create a Definition File
Create a new definition file (e.g., update.def). This file will use your existing SIF as the base and specify which new files to add.

Code snippet

Bootstrap: localimage
From: /path/to/your/original_container.sif

%help
    This container adds new_data_directory to the original container.

%files
    # This copies 'new_data_directory' from your host
    # into the /opt/ directory inside the new container.
    /path/to/your/new_data_directory /opt/
### Step 2: Build the New SIF
Use singularity build to create the new container. This process will start with the contents of your original SIF and then add the files specified in the %files section.

💻 Command:

Bash

sudo singularity build new_container.sif update.def
You now have new_container.sif, which contains everything from the original plus your new directory.

## Method 2: Using a Writable Sandbox (For Quick Changes)
This method is faster for interactive, one-off changes but is not easily reproducible.

### Step 1: Convert the SIF to a Writable Sandbox
A sandbox is a directory that contains the entire container filesystem, which you can modify directly.

💻 Command:

Bash

sudo singularity build --sandbox my_sandbox/ /path/to/your/original_container.sif
### Step 2: Copy Files into the Sandbox
Use the standard cp command to copy your files or directories directly into the sandbox.

💻 Command:

Bash

cp -r /path/to/your/new_data_directory ./my_sandbox/opt/
### Step 3: Convert the Sandbox Back into a SIF
Once you have added all your files, convert the modified sandbox directory back into a new, immutable SIF file.

💻 Command:

Bash

sudo singularity build new_container.sif my_sandbox/
## Which Method to Use?
Definition File: Best for production, sharing, and any workflow that needs to be repeatable.

Sandbox: Best for quick testing, debugging, or one-time tasks where you don't need a record of the changes.

%help
    This container is based on the official Intel oneAPI Runtime image:
    intel/oneapi-runtime:2024.2.0-devel-ubuntu20.04

    It includes the necessary libraries and tools for running applications
    built with the Intel oneAPI toolkits.

%environment
    # The official Intel Docker image already sets up the environment,
    # but we can source this to ensure it's always active.
    # The > /dev/null prevents the script's output from cluttering the console.
    source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh > /dev/null

%runscript
    echo "Container based on intel/oneapi-runtime:2024.2.0-devel-ubuntu20.04"
    echo "The oneAPI environment is active. Pass a command to run it."
    exec "$@"
